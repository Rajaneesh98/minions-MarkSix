# Banana_Talk

The language of the Minions (sometimes called "Minionese" or the "Banana language") in the Dispicable Me series is a mashup of several different languages from all over the world. Spanish, Indonesian and Malay, Japanese, Italian, and several other languages have worked their way into Minion-talk throughout.
